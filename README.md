Enter pincode and minimum age and click "check vaccine availability" button to start application.
The script will keep checking availability in every 30 minutes and will raise youtube alarm if slots are available.
Also if slots are available, center name and date will appear on screen.
To check for multiple pincodes, open same page in multiple tabs and run each tab for different pincode.
Do not try for more than 5 pincodes in a single machine.
Do not close the tab to keep the script running.
The reason for mentioning 5 pincodes max is to reduce pressure on cowin website, for same reasons do not reduce polling time beyond 30 minutes else too much traffic will go to cowin API. Please you this capabilty responsibly.
